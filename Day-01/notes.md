## ✅ What I Did Today

- 🟢 **Created GitHub Repository** → `MERN-Learning-Journey`  
  > This repo will be my **coding diary + project hub + portfolio** 💻  
  - Structure will include:  
    - Daily notes  
    - Practice code  
    - Mini-projects  
    - Major MERN projects  

- 🔎 **Learned what MERN stack means**  
  - **M** → MongoDB 🗄️ (NoSQL Database)  
  - **E** → Express ⚡ (Backend framework for Node.js)  
  - **R** → React ⚛️ (Frontend library for building UIs)  
  - **N** → Node.js 🌍 (JavaScript runtime environment)  
  > 👉 *One language (JavaScript) to rule them all — frontend + backend + database queries.*  

- ⚙️ **Installed Development Tools**  
  - ✅ Node.js (for running JavaScript outside the browser)  
  - ✅ VS Code (code editor with extensions support)  
  - ✅ Git (for version control & pushing code to GitHub)  

- 👨‍💻 **Wrote My First JavaScript Program**  
  ```javascript
